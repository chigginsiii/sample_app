Sample App!

The THIRD app From [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org)
by [*Michael Hart*](http:///michaelhartl.com) and painstakingly
keyed by [*Creighton Higgins*](http:chiggins.com).

### 3 chapters in after about 30 hours or so

* built 3 rudimentary apps and deployed them to heroku.
* got postgres going locally and rails seems happy with it
* have guard and spork running
* am getting ears and eyes for how the layers flow

Years of my career have been spent working on proprietary frameworks. Infrastructure built by hand from test harnesses to persistance layers. And it was all good experience!

But right now I'm thinking about how amazing it is not to have to do that stuff by hand. And how it is that everything seems to be right about where I'd expect to find it. Splendid! Splendid!
